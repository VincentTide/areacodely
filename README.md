Areacodely
==========
A location lookup tool using the first six digits (area code and prefix) of a United States phone number. Data is gathered from the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA). Written in Python, Flask web framework and PostgreSQL database.

At the moment, the NANPA dataset is not a complete dataset. In particular, it is missing several cellular phone blocks. Landline phone numbers have a much better success rate.
